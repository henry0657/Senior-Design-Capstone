The repository for all of the code used for the roadside flood detector we created.

Henry Toups, Computer Engineering EE4820 
Street Flood Warning System

These 3 folders contain the code used for the project as follows:

Folder: prototype
		Contains the Android Studio folder for the App, if placed into Android Studio the entirety of the App can be run.

Folder: Website/PHP Code
		Contains all of the PHP scripts to make the microprocessor send data, as well as the app/website querying the database for data.  Also contains code for the website, including a style sheet for the style of the website. All of this code is hosted on a free website by biz.nf. 

Folder: Microprocessor Code
		Contains the code initially from the build.particle.io site that I wrote to make the microprocessor run.  the file prototype-full.cpp is the full, final, operating code of the microprocessor.  The rest of the files are test files of each individual component of the prototype-full code.  This code if placed into the Particle Build IDE and flashed to a Particle Electron, will operate the project.
